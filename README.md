# NTL-TCN
The paper associated with this repository is currently submitted to __JGR: Machine Learning and Computation__. A preprint is availiable in __ESS OPEN ARCHIVE__ as:

Kaan CÃ¶kerim, Henryk Dobslaw, Kyriakos Balidakis, Laura Jensen, Carlos Pena and Jonathan Bedford. _Modeling Non-Tidal Surface Fluid Loading Signatures in Global GNSS Displacements with a Deep Learning Framework_. ESS Open Archive . September 15, 2024. DOI: 10.22541/essoar.172641527.77043060/v1

# Abstract
"INSERT TEXT"

# What this repository contains
This repository contains a minimal example with data to reproduce the results of the paper. In particular, it contains: 
- `hdf5` files containing targets, predictions and NTL time series of the stations _POVE_ and _MCHL_. `tabels_all.zip` contains all sets for the 299 IGS core station networks
- `.pth`-Files containing the trained model
- codes to evaluate the model with the NTL input data and to produce time series figures:
  - `plot_predictions_from_hdf5.ipynb`: notebook to plot time series of targets, predictions, and NTL input data
  - `predict_eval.ipynb`: notebook to predict time series at a selected station
- data fetching scripts for NGL PPP solutions and decomposition using __GrAtSiD__:
  - `NGL_download.py`: script to scrape [NGL](http://geodesy.unr.edu/index.php) for time series (run at your own risk; may cause heavy download traffic)
  - `decompse.py`: script to decompose [NGL](http://geodesy.unr.edu/index.php) time series into _a priori_ non-tectonic time series targets using [GrAtSiD](https://github.com/TectonicGeodesy-RUB/Gratsid)
- to compile the __ESMGFZ__ loading data first download the netCDF files and interpolated the respective time series at the station locations using their instruction and codes in the [ESMGFZ repository](http://esmdata.gfz-potsdam.de:8080/repository/entry/show?entryid=97d15ffe-3b5d-49dc-ba6c-3011851af1de). 
  - `prep_ntl.ipynb` agglomerates and segments the NTL data obtained from the ESMGFZ script for easier processing at scale
  - use `surfaceloading.py` to further process the ESMGFZ data and obtain time series like the examples in in `data/ESMGFZ`
- the IGS repro3 time series can be freely downloaded from the __IGN__ repository from ther FTP server under `ftp://igs-rf.ign.fr/pub/repro3/`. Use an FTP accessing tool of your choice to access and download the data.
- OS LISFLOOD data is currently under review, but we provide for selected stations time series in `data/OS_LISFLOOD`

# What will come in future releases
- work directory set up script to prepare all folders for data retrival and processing. As of now, the user has to go through the code and create the folders on the fly
- hosting of the full data set files with all ~12,000 stations on a separate large-file hosting server

# Availability of Associated Data
The original GNSS displacement time series are obtained from the Nevada Geodetic Laboratory (Blewitt et al., 2018) and are openly available in the NGL data repository under http://geodesy.unr.edu/index.php (Last accessed for download: 01 June 2024). 

Additional GNSS time series were composed based on the combined IGS repro3 solution (Rebischung et al., 2024) retrieved from `ftp://igs-rf.ign.fr/pub/repro3/`. Please visit the IGN webpage to retrieve their data.

The geophysical non-tidal surface loading products by Dill and Dobslaw (2013) are available at the ESMGFZ data repository http://esmdata.gfz-potsdam.de:8080/repository/entry/show?entryid=97d15ffe-3b5d-49dc-ba6c-3011851af1de (Last accessed for download: 01 June 2024). Please follow the manual on their webpage to retrieve the data accordingly.

The GrAtSiD trajectory modeling software by Bedford and Bevis (2018) is available on the GitHub repository of the Tectonic Geodesy group at Ruhr-University Bochum on https://github.com/TectonicGeodesy-RUB/Gratsid.
